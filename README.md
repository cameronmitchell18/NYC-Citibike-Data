## Link to Story

This was built using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cam6394/viz/Citibike_Data_16560980437220/CitibikeDataStory?publish=yes).

## Overview of the analysis:

This project was intended to get comfortable with using Tableau to visualize data. The data that was used was taken from Citibike and broken down to show how long bikes were checked out for, which sex uses Citibikes more, what time and days of the week are Citibikes most used, and are subscribers or customers the ones who are using Citibikes the most. All of these questions have been answered in a clean and visual way using Tableau and Tableau Stories.
